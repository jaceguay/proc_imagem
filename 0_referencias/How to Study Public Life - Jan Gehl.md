‘Look and learn’ is the underlying motto of this book: get   out in the city, see how it works, use your common sense,   use all senses, and then ask whether this is the city we want (How to Study Public Life, p.12)

Public life should   also be understood in the broadest sense as everything   that takes place between buildings, to and from school,   on balconies, seated, standing, walking, biking, etc. It is everything we can go out and observe happening (How to Study Public Life, p.17)

However, we do not   mean city life to be understood as the city’s psychological   well-being. Rather it is the complex and versatile life that   unfolds in public space.  (How to Study Public Life, p.17)

The core of the matter is to get   the large volumes of life in public spaces to function in a   way that allows daily life to take place under decent conditions and partner with the physical framework instead of   fighting against it.    (How to Study Public Life, p.18)

The direct observations   help to understand why some spaces are used and others   are not. (How to Study Public Life, p.18)

Studying people’s behavior in public space can be com-  pared to studying and structuring other forms of living   organisms. They could be animals or cells: counting how   many there are in total, how quickly they move under various conditions, and generally describing how they behave   on the basis of systematic observation. (How to Study Public Life, p.20)

The observations are conducted with the naked eye and occasionally using cameras or   other aids to zoom in on situations or fast-freeze the mo-  ment in order to analyze the situation more closely. The   point is to sharpen the gaze of the observer.   (How to Study Public Life, p.20)

In general, the observer must be as neutral as the prover-  bial 'fly on the wall' (How to Study Public Life, p.20)

observe. “You must try more slowly,   almost foolishly. Force yourself to write down what is not   of interest, the most banal, ordinary, colorless. (How to Study Public Life, p.20)

Perec, the observer must look and take the time needed   to really see the ordinariness unfolding in public space.   (How to Study Public Life, p.20)

see.”6 According to Jacobs,   when you are in the city you should take the time to reflect   over what you are sensing (How to Study Public Life, p.20)

In their revolt against modernism’s abstract planning, city-  life study pioneers such as Jane Jacobs, William H. Whyte   and Jan Gehl encouraged people to see the interaction of (How to Study Public Life, p.20)

city life and space with their own eyes (How to Study Public Life, p.21)

to observe, using one’s   senses, common sense and simple registration techniques   with pen and paper, which is why we emphasize these   manual methods. (How to Study Public Life, p.21)

divide the variety of activities and people   into subcategories (How to Study Public Life, p.26)

focus attention on who, what, where and other basic   questions can provide general knowledge about behavior   in public space (How to Study Public Life, p.26)

How many people are walking and how many are station-  ary?  (How to Study Public Life, p.27)

In Brighton New Road, a public life study helped to   determine use before and after improvements were made.   The number of pedestrians rose by 62 after the street   was converted into a pedestrian-priority street in 2006. The   number of stationary activities increased by 600.   (How to Study Public Life, p.27)

**Question 1. How Many?** (How to Study Public Life, p.28)

If we know how many people   are staying in a square, and we then improve the square and   count the number of people again, we can evaluate the suc-  cess of the renewal project. (How to Study Public Life, p.28)

Starting with the question of how many is basic to public   life studies. In principle, everything can be counted, but   what is often registered is how many people are moving   (pedestrian flow) and how many are staying in one place   (stationary activity).    (How to Study Public Life, p.28)

Factual conditions like   weather and time of day must also be noted consistently   and precisely so that similar studies can be conducted at   a later date. (How to Study Public Life, p.28)

**Question 2. Who?**  (How to Study Public Life, p.29)

The general question of gender and age can be registered by observation (How to Study Public Life, p.29)

It is difficult or impossible to categorize people with   respect to job or economic situation, for example, on the   basis of observation alone.   (How to Study Public Life, p.29)

While registration can be done on the individual level, it   is often more meaningful to investigate more general cat-  egories such as gender or age.    (How to Study Public Life, p.29)

In Bryant Park the ideal gender division is on the order   of 52 women and 48 men. If the percentage of wom-  en falls, it could be a sign that park safety is on the wane.   Weather conditions do play a role, however, as Bryant Park’s   data show that the number of women in the park increases   in warmer weather.5 (How to Study Public Life, p.29)

**Question 3. Where?**   (How to Study Public Life, p.30)

it is often   relevant to study where people stay: on the edges, in   the middle or evenly distributed in the space? In public,   semi-public or private zones? The where question allows   observers to zoom in on positioning relevant to function or   elements such as furniture, garden gates, entrances, doors,   bollards, etc.   (How to Study Public Life, p.30)

On the   city level this can mean registering or localizing numerous   functions, activities, direction of pedestrian flow and   preferred places to stay. (How to Study Public Life, p.30)

Microclimate, the local climate of a specific site, can heavily   impact whether people stay there. If people are walking   from point A to point B, they can usually live with sub-  optimal wind, sun or shadow conditions, but for staying   activites a place needs a higher level of climate quality.    (How to Study Public Life, p.30)

 The   photo also illustrates how trees serve as a focal point, how   many people use benches, and the fact that people keep   a certain social distance between themselves. That people   attract more people is also exemplified. (How to Study Public Life, p.30)

The where question can relate to where people situate   themselves relative to other people, buildings and city   spaces or to the climatic conditions.  (How to Study Public Life, p.30)

This illustration of necessary and optional activities comes   from "People on Foot" by Jan Gehl in the architectural jour-  nal Arkitekten in 1968 (How to Study Public Life, p.31)

book New City Life (How to Study Public Life, p.31)

**Question 4. What?**   (How to Study Public Life, p.32)

Broadly speaking, the primary activities in public space   are walking, standing, sitting and playing. (How to Study Public Life, p.32)

In general, public space activities can be divided into two   categories: ==necessary and optional==.  (How to Study Public Life, p.32)
